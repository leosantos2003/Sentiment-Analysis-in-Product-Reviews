# Sentiment Analysis in Product Reviews

## About

This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on product reviews from a Brazilian e-commerce site. To achieve this, we fine-tuned BERT, one of the most advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, to classify review texts as positive or negative.

The model was trained and evaluated using a [public Olist dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce), available on Kaggle, containing thousands of real customer reviews.
